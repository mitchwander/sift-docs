An international team of forensics experts, led by SANS Faculty Fellow Rob Lee, created the SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation and made it available to the forensics community as a public service. The free SIFT toolkit, that rivals any modern forensic tool suite, is also featured in the SANS Advanced Computer Forensic Analysis and Incident Response course (FOR 508). SIFT demonstrates that advanced investigations and intrusion response can be accomplished using cutting-edge, freely available and frequently updated open-source tools.

The SIFT Workstation is a VMware appliance, pre-configured with the necessary tools to perform detailed digital forensic examination in a variety of settings. It is compatible with Expert Witness Format (E01), Advanced Forensic Format (AFF), and raw (dd) evidence formats. The brand new SIFT 2.14 has been completely rebuilt on an Ubuntu base with many new capabilities and tools such as log2timeline that provides a timeline that can be of enormous value to investigators.

[MW Comment: Not sure that it makes sense to use log2timeline as an example here if on another page it says:
"This tool is being deprecated in favor of :doc:`/tools/plaso`"]

SIFT 2.0 was a massive success; SIFT 2.14 will hope to again exceed expectations. As voted by you, the readers, the 2010 Toolsmith Tool of the Year was SIFT 2.0. The SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation Version 2.0, as profiled in the May 2010 ISSA Journal, is a Linux distribution that is preconfigured for forensic investigations. SIFT 2.0 includes all the tools a forensic analyst/incident responder would require to conduct a thorough system investigation. I particularly favor it for memory analysis - grab a memory image from your victim system; pull it back to your SIFT VM and get down to business in no time flat.
